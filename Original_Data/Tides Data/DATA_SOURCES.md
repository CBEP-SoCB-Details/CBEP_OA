Data for the Portland Tide Gage were downloaded by Curtis C. Bohlen via a NOAA API, using the CBEP program "Portland High Low Tides Access.py".  The program was edited by hand to specify dates and output filenames.

A similar program offering relatedfunctionality is available at the CBEP SotB 2020 github repository for Portland Sea Level.
